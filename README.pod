=head1 NAME

Object::Tiny::Lvalue - minimal class builder with lvalue accessors

=head1 VERSION

version 1.082

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Define a class:

  package Foo;
  use Object::Tiny::Lvalue qw( bar baz );
  1;

Use the class:

  my $object = Foo->new( bar => 1 );
  printf "bar is %s\n", $object->bar;
  $object->bar = 2;
  printf "bar is now %s\n", $object->bar;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a clone of L<Object::Tiny|Object::Tiny>, but adjusted to create accessors that return lvalues.

You probably want to use L<Object::Properties|Object::Properties> instead.
